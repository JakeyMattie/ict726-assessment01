                <h2>Recognition under the Australian Qualification Framework</h2>
                <p>All KOI courses are accredited by TEQSA (Tertiary Education and Quality Standards Agency) and consistent with the AQF (Australian Qualifications Framework). TEQSA regulates qualifications in the Australian education system.</p>
                <p>This means that KOI is recognised as providing its students with quality education for the courses on offer in line with Australia’s Higher Education Standards.</p>
                <img src="#" alt="Australian Qualifications Framework" />
                <p>The Course Overview – can be used to view the course structure and sequence in which subjects should be studied. All subjects named (LISTED) in the Course Overviews are core subjects and must be studied to satisfy the requirements of the particular award.</p>
                <p>The subjects in shaded boxes must be studied in the order they are presented as they provide pre-requisite knowledge for other subjects. The remaining subjects (core and elective) have a recommended trimester, but may be studied in other available trimester slots to suit individual student preferences, provided pre-requisites have been completed.</p>
                <p>Students may choose any elective subjects from the list following the Course Overview, provided the subject is offered in the trimester they wish to study it and they have met the relevant pre-requisites.</p>

                <h2>Master of Information Technology (CRICOS 0100969)</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Master of Information Technology</strong> (16 subject program) is studied over 4 trimesters spread over 2 calendar years. Students can choose to make use of the 3 trimesters offered and study continuously to reduce the time of their course completion. The course is designed for students from an IT background who have successfully completed an undergraduate degree in an IT area (information technology, information systems, software engineering, computer science) or students who have completed a Graduate Certificate of IT or Graduate Diploma of IT. The course includes core subjects in programming, database, project management and emerging technologies. The course also provides electives and specialisations in data analytics and cybersecurity which allows students to tailor their learning needs to suit their career goals. This course prepares the student for the growing demand from business for graduates to be able to work with emerging technologies. The capstone project ensures that students have the opportunity to gain experience applying their theoretical knowledge and practical skills to a significant real world project. It is anticipated that the Master of Information Technology will produce graduates who not only have the skills to help them achieve their career goals, but also the ability to make a significant, positive contribution to the workplace and to the society in which they live.</p>

                <h3>Possible Career Paths</h3>
                <p>Depending on the specialisations chosen, graduates of the Master of Information Technology may find employment as a Software and Applications Programmer, Web Developer, System Analyst, Analyst Programmer, Cybersecurity Specialist, Security Architect, Security Analyst or Data Analyst. The course has also been designed as a pathway to ICT manager, ICT Consultant and Business Analyst.</p>
